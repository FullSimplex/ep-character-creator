('Anarchist', 'You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of social organization and directly democratic decision- making. You believe power is always corrupting and everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive policies of the inner system and Jovian Junta, this makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter- rorist at worst. In your opinion, that''s comedy coming from governments that keep their populations in line with economic oppression and threats of violence.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Ape Uplift', 'Neo-gorillas and neo-orangutans have integrated well with transhumanity, but they still haven''t shaken their reputation for aggressiveness. Your drive to be in control of your social group and environment-- a remnant of your species'' social competitiveness and group hierarchies--chafes at the prejudice and restrictions you find in most habitats. Due to your perceived "anti-social tendencies," it can be difficult to find a place in society outside of military, police, or criminal organisations.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Hominid, Neo-Hominid\n(Gorillas) (p. 143, Panopticon)', 'ORI'),
('Argonaut', 'You are part of a scientific technoprogressive movement that seeks to solve transhumanity''s injustices and inequalities with technology. You support universal access to technology and healthcare, open-source models of production, morphological freedom, and democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and divisive politics, seeing transhumanity splintering as a hindrance to its perpetuation.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Barsoomian', 'You call the Martian outback and wilds your home. You are a "redneck," a lower-class Martian from the rural areas that often\nfind themselves in conflict with the policies and goals of the hyper- corp domes and Tharsis League.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Flats, Rusters, Splicers, Synths', 'FAC'),
('Belter', 'Most people see the Belt as a waypoint between the inner and outer system, teeming with pirates and criminals, or a simple resource to be exploited. For you, the Belt is the true melting pot of transhumanity, where you can find a sampling of all the major factions and the best and worst of each.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Bouncers, Splicers, Synths', 'FAC'),
('Bioconservative', '<b>Must start with a Flat or Splicer morph, may not start with any nanoware or advanced nano tech</b>\n<br><br>\nYou think transhumanity is recklessly careening down a dangerous path and putting the entire species at risk. You may have religious objections to resleeving, forking, and uplifts, or you may simply believe tech- nology should be restricted by the authorities for the security of everyone.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Flats and Splicers', 'FAC'),
('Bonobo Uplift', 'Your species is among the most enthusiastic when it comes to assimilating into transhuman cultures, and you are no exception. The large, vibrant social groups, the constant interaction, and the pervasive--if unspoken--focus on sex and sexuality makes your own impulses and tendencies an almost perfect fit. Although other uplifts might belittle you for pandering to transhumans, and some transhumans claim you''re too naÃ¯ve to realize the way your uplifters moved your species towards work in entertainment, XP, and porn, you actually have many more opportunities and wider acceptance than almost any other uplifts except your cousins the chimps. So long as you have friends--and if you''re lucky, family--to share this life with, you''re happy.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Hominid, Pleasure Pod, Sylph', 'ORI'),
('Brinker', 'You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of the trans- humanity and the various goings-on in the rest of the system. Your particular grouping may have sought out self-imposed isolation to pursue their own interests, or they may have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs. Or you may simply be a loner who prefers the vast emptiness of space to socializing with others. You might be a religious cultist, a primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether uninterested in transhumanity.<br><br>\n<b> Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Cetacean Uplift', 'You are used to living with a tight-knit pack that had no secrets. Like others of your kind, you are always in motion, always expressive, and quite often playing tricks and games. As an aquatic creature, there are only a few locations that you can call home, if you want to thrive in your natural form.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Beluga, Neo-Dolphin,\nNeo-Orca, Neo-Porpoise, Neo-Whale (pp. 142-143, Panopticon)', 'ORI'),
('Chimp Uplift', 'You come from the first and most populous uplifted species, and the one generally perceived as closest to humans. As a chimp, you dont suffer from the same level of scorn as other species and have more possi- bilities for success, but your life is still limited by laws and prejudice throughout the system. Will you work to push for more rights and recognition for all species or take advantage of the slim acceptance you enjoy to live an easier life than other uplifts?\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Hominid', 'ORI'),
('Corvid Uplift', 'You have all the best and worst tendencies of your species: excellent three- and four-dimensional thinking, a knack for finding objects you can put to use, and an unfortunate and overwhelming habit of adding new things to your nest.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Chickcharnie (p. 142,\nPanopticon), Neo-Avian, Ripwing (p. 151, Gatecrashing)', 'ORI'),
('Criminal', 'You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld. You may work with one of the Sol system''s major criminal factions--triads, the Night Cartel, the ID Crew, Nine Lives, Pax Familae--or one of the smaller, local operators with a big stake in a specific habitat. You might be a vetted member-for-life, a reluctant recruit, or just a freelancer looking for the next gig.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Drifter', 'You were raised with a social grouping that remained on the move throughout the Sol system. This could have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scavengers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roaming space travel between habitats and stations. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All, especially Bouncers and Hibernoids', 'ORI'),
('Emergent Agi Uplift', '<b>must start with an infomorph / eidolon</b><br><br>\nAs a pre-sapient complex software system, you may have emerged into full intelligence on your own, given enough time. Your potential was recognized, however, and you were "uplifted" with an upgraded, human- based neural network and a program of socialization to make you friendly and conducive to human values and modes of thought. You are not quite as assimilated as programmed AGIs, however. While you are at least capable of functionally interacting with transhumans, their thought processes and social behaviors are quite often a complete mystery to you. Many emergent uplifts also have the Anomalous Mind trait.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon', 'ORI'),
('Europan', 'As a Europan, you consider your home the most enlightened polity in Jovian space. You value science and a technoprogressive agenda, while opposing the bioconservatism of the Junta and its dominance around Jupiter. The ocean depths are the focal point of your interests and culture.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cetus (p. 185, Rimward),\nEuropan biomorph variants (p. 188, Rimward), Selkie (p. 187, Rimward)', 'FAC'),
('Exhuman', 'Humanity is weak, and you intend to elevate your body and mind to a superior state of existence. You embrace new and developing technologies, no matter how dangerous and untested, to perfect your physical form and upgrade your mind. You intend to survive and dominate, no matter the cost.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any, but heavily modified', 'FAC'),
('Extropian', 'You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and private property. You oppose government and favor a system where secu- rity and legal matters are handled by private competitors. Whether you consider yourself an anarcho-capitalist or a mutualist (a differ- ence only other Extropians can figure out), you occupy a middle ground between the hypercorps and autonomists, dealing with both and yet trusted by neither.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Fall Evacuee', 'You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life (and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones) behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with your body intact and continue to make a life for your- self out in the system.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats, Splicers', 'ORI'),
('Feral Uplift', '<b>must start with an uplift biomorph</b><br><br>\nBy design or accident, your uplift moved you to full sapience but did nothing to change your instincts or social impulses. The morality and social behaviors of other transhumans are a mystery and only worth understanding to the extent needed for your own survival. You will do as you must to survive, but you long to live the way your natural impulses dictate. Many feral uplifts also have the Anomalous Mind trait.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b>Any uplift biomorph', 'ORI'),
('Humanities Infolife', 'Your digital mind emulates human minds and values as closely as your neuroprogrammers could make it. You were specifically designed to blend in with transhumans and work closely with them.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon, Basic Pod, Pleasure Pod, Specialist Pod', 'ORI'),
('Hypercorp', 'You hail from a habitat controlled by the hypercorps. You might be a hypercapitalist entrepeneur, a hedonistic socialite, or a lowly vacworker, but you accept that certain liberties must be sacrificed for security and freedom.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Olympians, Splicers, Sylphs', 'FAC'),
('Hyperelite', 'You are privileged to have been raised as part of the immortal upper class that rules many inner system habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with wealth and influence that most people can only dream of.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Sylphs', 'ORI'),
('Indenture', 'You may have handed yourself over to the hyper-corps before the Fall, going off-world to escape a life of violence and misery on Earth, or you may have escaped the horrors of the Fall as an infugee. Either way, you left Earth with nothing, and you spent years selling your time and labor as an indenture. Now you''ve earned your freedom and are taking your first cautious steps back into transhuman society as your own person. You might only have a dim understanding of current events and culture--your activities and news sources were heavily restricted during your indenture--but your work has helped you sharpen some skills and come away with a decent understanding of new corporate culture.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Splicers, Rusters', 'ORI'),
('Infolife', 'You entered existence as a digital consciousness-- an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs). Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you do have full autonomy.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Infomorphs, synthetic morphs', 'ORI'),
('Isolate', 'You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated from other factions.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'ORI'),
('Jovian', 'Your faction is noted for its authoritarian regime, bioconservative ideologies, and militaristic tendencies. Where you come from, technology is not to be trusted and humans need to be protected from themselves. To ensure its survival, humanity must be able to defend itself and unfettered growth must be checked. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats and Splicers', 'FAC'),
('Lost', 'You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles since the Fall. As a member of the Lost generation, you went through an accelerated-growth childhood, somehow surviving where others of your kind died, went insane, or were persecuted.<br>\nYour background is a social stigma, but it does provide you with certain advantages ... and burdens. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Futuras', 'ORI'),
('Lunar', 'You hail from Luna, the original off-Earth colony world. Now overpopulated and in decline, Luna is one of the few places where people still cling to old- Earth ethnic and national identities. Your home is also within sight of Earth, a constant reminder that encourages many "Loonies" to be reclaimers, deploring the hypercorp interdiction and arguing that you have a right to return to Earth, terraform it, and re-establish it as a living homeworld.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Exalts, Flats, Splicers, Synths', 'FAC'),
('Lunar Colonist', 'You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth''s moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Flats, Splicers', 'ORI'),
('Machine Infolife', 'You were programmed to facilitate transhumanity''s interactions with complex systems. You understand computers, robots, and machines more than you do transhumance.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorph/Eidolon, Specialist\nPod, Synth, Worker Pod', 'ORI'),
('Maker Nomad', 'The sparsely settled high desert of northern Mars is your homeland--one your people are slowly converting into a new home for transhumanity. You''ve been raised from childhood to be a consummate engineer while respecting the delicate balance of the evolving Martian climate. The sufi nomads are allies, and perhaps blood relations, to your maker clan. Your upbringing gives you an edge at surviving on improvisation in the harshest of climes.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Dragonfly, Martian Alpiner\n(p. 162, Sunward), Ruster', 'ORI'),
('Martian', 'You were raised in a station on or above Mars, now the most populated planet in the system. Your home town may or may not have survived the Fall. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flats, Splicers, and Rusters', 'ORI'),
('Mercurial', 'Your faction has no interest in co-opting their true natures in order to become more "human." You might be an AGI that does not necessarily intertwine its destiny with transhumanity or an uplift that seeks to preserve and promote non-human life (or at least your own species). You might even be an infomorph or posthuman who has strayed so far from transhuman interests and values that you now consider yourself to be forging a unique new path of life.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Infomorphs, Synths, uplift morphs', 'FAC'),
('Neanderthal Uplift', 'Until a few decades ago, your species was extinct. The first resurrected neo-neanderthals had no pre-existing culture to build upon, but that hasn''t stopped your kind from inventing something new, even if you really are just making it up as you go along.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Neanderthal (p. 162,\nSunward), Splicer', 'ORI'),
('Octopus Uplift', 'Yours is the least-human uplifted species. More so than other uplifts, you think and live a step apart from transhuman norms. By nature inclined to solitude and a restful, reactive life, the frenetic pace and hyperac- tive socializing of most transhumans is strange and off-putting. You must work to engage with others as a new type of protective camouflage, lest you be left isolated, exposed, and out-competed.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Flying Squid, Octomorph,\nTakko (p. 144, Panopticon)', 'ORI'),
('Orbital', 'You still call Earth your home, though you never set foot there--you watch it from above, planning one day to return. Orbital society is a mash-up of Earth cultures that cling to their old ways and traditions. Progress isn''t as important to you as remembering where you came from.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Splicers, Synths', 'FAC'),
('Original Space Colonist', 'You or your parents were part of the first "generations" of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older stations and habitats. As a "zero-one g" (zero-gravity, first-gen), you were never part of the elite. People from your background typically have some sort of special- ized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs. <br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All. Use of exotic morphs is common', 'ORI'),
('Outster', 'You have made your home in the far outer reaches of the solar system, living among others that no longer have interest in transhuman affairs and are methodically sloughing off their old ways. You may be intent on leaving the solar system for good, diving into a new virtual existence, or pursuing some other private or unusual interest far away from others.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Bouncers, Flexbots, Infomorphs', 'FAC'),
('Parrot Uplift', 'You have an easier time than most other uplift species when dealing with transhumans, as parrots were often viewed as smart and beautiful companion animals. As most people have positive stereotypes that you''ll be gregarious and entertaining, it''s easier to get on in life, but that also requires playing in to those stereotypes with funny impressions, non-sequiturs, and keeping your plumage bright.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Avian', 'ORI'),
('Pig Uplift', 'You have more of a place in society than many uplifts. Although your species was only recently uplifted, it has quickly become widespread because you make excellent workers. Pigs are smart, dedicated, have excellent memories, and can pick up trades quickly. You left the lab with some in-demand skills, an honest shot at a job, and a way to take care of yourself. There''s still discrimination, and you have to watch for some legal restrictions here and there, but by sticking to the right habs and keeping your snout down there''s a good life if you work for it.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Neo-Pig (p. 143, Panopticon)', 'ORI'),
('Precautionist', 'You take a stance between the bioconservatives and technoprogressives: technology should be proven safe, before it is widely adopted. You favor restricting access to new technologies, offering incentives for hypercorps to pursue thorough safety tests, and harshly punishing those who recklessly deploy dangerous tech.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any', 'FAC'),
('Re-Instantiated', 'You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body died there, but your backup was transmitted offworld, and you were one of the lucky few to be reinstantiated with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave. <br><br>\n<b> Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Infomorphs, Synths', 'ORI'),
('Reclaimer', 'To your point of view, transhumanity is nothing without its homeworld. Reclaiming Earth from the machines isn''t just important for self-identity, it''s proof that transhumanity can overcome its obstacles and claim its place in the universe.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any', 'FAC'),
('Research Infolife', 'You were programmed to analyze and study, with the express intent of aiding transhuman scientific endeavours.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>Infomorph/Eidolon,\nSpecialist Pod, Synth', 'ORI'),
('Ringer', 'You call the rings and moonlets of Saturn your home. Though you enjoy the isolation and quiet when you are out soaring the vacuum, you also consider yourself part of a community of eccentrics, scientists, and other bringers.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Bouncer, Courier (p. 185,\nRimward), Novacrab, Ring Flyer (p. 187, Rimward)', 'FAC'),
('Sapient', 'You believe that uplifts and AGIs are as much a part of transhumanity as humans, and therefore deserve equal rights and liberties. In the same vein, you uphold that all life has value and that the personhood of all sapient creatures should be recognized.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any', 'FAC'),
('Scum', 'This is the future we''ve all been waiting for, and you''re going to enjoy it to the max. A paradigm shift has occurred, and while everyone else is catching up, your faction embraces and revels in it. There is no more want, no more death, no more limits on what you can be. The scum have immersed themselves in a new way of life, changing themselves as they see fit, trying out new experiences, and pushing the boundar- ies wherever they can ... and fuck anyone who can''t deal with that.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs: </b>All', 'FAC'),
('Scumborn', 'You were raised in the nomadic and chaotic lifestyle common to scum barges.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All, especially Bouncers', 'ORI'),
('Sifter', 'You are a proud and independent member of Mercury''s nomadic and proletarian mining culture. You prefer to live free of any corporate entanglements, but the harsh realities of survival on Mercury mean you must sometimes deal with your hypercorp neighbours.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Arachnoids, Cases, Synths,\nWorker Pods', 'FAC'),
('Singularity Seeker', 'Everyone agrees the TITANs were a problem, but to you they were also a harbinger. If transhumanity has any hope of survival, in the universe, it must expand its mental capabilities by several orders of magnitude. You have dedicated yourself to finding a way to achieve an exponential increase in intelli- gence and ascending to a new, god-like state of existence--whether you want this just for yourself or for everyone is up to you.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Hyperbright (p. 186, Rimward), Menton, Savant (p. 187, Rimward)', 'FAC'),
('Skimmer', 'You hail from the brinker culture that thrives in the upper atmosphere of Uranus and Neptune, populated by misfits, loners, outcasts, and survivalists. The one thing that binds you together is the struggle for exis- tence in the outer reaches. Gas mining provides a way of life, but the thrill of racing the winds and storms of the ice giants is what makes you feel alive.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Any', 'FAC'),
('Socialite', 'You are a member of the inner system glitterati, the media-saturated social cliques that set trends, spread memes, and make or break lives with whispers, innu- endo, and backroom deals. You are simultaneously an icon and a devout follower. Culture isn''t just your life, it''s your weapon of choice.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Olympians, Sylphs', 'FAC'),
('Solarian', 'You have surrendered the stresses and concerns of transhuman affairs and embraced the serene, nomadic, and free-wheeling ways of the pods of surya that swim around the sun.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Salamander, Sundiver, Surya\n(pp. 163-164, Sunward)', 'FAC'),
('Sufi Nomad', 'The people of your clan raised you to be a salik--a wayfarer, striving for purity of heart, intoxicated by the love of God. Your clan shared the northern deserts of Mars with the maker clans--your allies and sometimes blood relations. Your upbringing taught you both to survive and to evade the notice of greedy hypercorps. Whether or not you still hold to the spiritual aspects of your upbringing, you are a child of the Martian desert--a land as beautiful as it is forbidding.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Martian Alpiner (p. 162, Sunward), Olympian, Ruster', 'ORI'),
('Titanian', 'You are a participant in the Titanian Commonwealth''s socialist cyberdemocracy. Unlike other autonomist proj- ects, Titanian joint efforts have assembled some impres- sive infrastructural projects as approved by the Titanian Plurality and pursued by state-owned microcorps.<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> All', 'FAC'),
('Titanian Hulder', 'You were an original colonist on Titan, but unlike the others that stayed in the habs, you went native. You and the other hulder adapted your forms to survive in the cryogenic Titanian environment, forging a new nomadic lifestyle.\n<br><br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Hulder (p. 186, Rimward)', 'ORI'),
('Ultimate', 'Your faction sees the potential in transhumanity''s future and looks back upon the rest of transhumanity as weak and hedonistic. Transhumanity is set to take the next evolutionary step and it''s time for transhu- mans to be redesigned to the best of our capabilities.<br><br>\n<b> Common Morphs:</b> Exalts, Remades', 'FAC'),
('Uplift', 'You are not even human. You were born as an uplifted animal: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, parrot, raven, crow, or octopus.<br><br>\n <b>Common Morphs:</b> Neo-Avian, Neo-Hominid,\nOctomorph', 'ORI'),
('Venusian', 'You are a supporter of the Morningstar Confederation of Venusian aerostats, resentful of the growing influence of the Planetary Consortium and other entrenched and conservative inner system powers. You see your faction''s ascension as a chance to reform the old guard ways of inner system politics. <br>br>\n<b>Common Morphs:</b> Cases, Exalts, Mentons, Splicers,\nSylphs, Synths', 'FAC');

An ego "sleeved" into an aquarium pet experiences being a fish, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco''s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi''s constant rifling of filthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal.

Known by a myriad of intriguing names--Forgotten Hand, Darkly Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few--Petals are post-Fall society''s heroin--the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals almost always appear as nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects imme- diately. Flowers have 5-10 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the Petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.\nPetal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some take place entirely in the user''s mesh inserts (the user must cede control of their implants voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other than producing very low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), taking control of the character''s entop- tic displays, linking to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invading the character''s sensorium with AR "hallucinations." Others put the character into a near-comatose state during which they go on a head trip. Normally there is some kind of well-developed theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some cases they just experience a stream of images.\nThough most societies seek to suppress Petals, new ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent sub- culture of crafters and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form (or at least as really good enter- tainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted, hauntingly beautiful experiences--even if they''re also terrifying. The subculture of Petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-dura- tion flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. From this subculture comes a lot of information on what various Petals look like and their effects. Because Petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.\nPetals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called "sweets" by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves.\nOn the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, inflicting 1d10 mental stress or more on the user. Perhaps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that takes over the user''s mesh inserts and worse-- some sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the exsurgent virus.

('Implant Memory', 'An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour''s length inside the target''s mind. This memory very obviously does not belong to the target--there is no way they will confuse it for one of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async''s memories in the target''s mind so that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for "archiving" important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspec- tive, or simply making a "data dump" for the target to peruse.<b> Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. </b>At the gamemaster''s discretion, particularly traumatic memories might inflict mental stress on the recipient.', 'ACT', 'TOUCH', 'instant', 'complex', 'GAM', '0', 'Control'),

For Task Actions that involve partial analysis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30% without penalty.</b>', 'PAS', 'SELF', 'constant', 'automatic', 'CHI', '0', 'none'),
('Mimic psi', 'In a setting where changing your body and face is not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and personality quirks more often. The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test.

('Mindlink', 'Mindlink allows two-way mental communication with a target. This may be used on more than one target simultaneously, in which case the async can act as a telepathic "server" so that everyone mindlinked with the async may also telepathically communicate\nwith each other (via the async, however, who over- hears). Language is still a factor in mindlinked communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations. <b>Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants.</b>', 'ACT', 'TOUCH', 'sustained', 'quick', 'GAM', '1', 'Control'),

It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial or fleeting attention, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they are concealing their observation).

('Pattern Recognition', 'The character is adept at spotting patterns and cor- relating the non-random elements of a jumble--related items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or finding clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample and time enough to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens or a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or codebreaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by soft- ware to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half.', 'PAS', 'SELF', 'constant', 'automatic', 'CHI', '0', 'none'),
('Penetration', 'Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.

('Predictive Boost', 'The Bayesian probability machine features of the async''s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async''s decision-making in combat situations by making the best course of action more clear and so provides a +1 bonus to Initiative and +10 to Fray Tests.', 'PAS', 'SELF', 'constant', 'automatic', 'CHI', '0', 'none'),
('Psi Shield', 'Psi Shield bolsters the async''s mind to psi attack and manipulation.

Though many animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few "ark" and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and many others can be resurrected from genetic samples. Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are occasionally used to protect high-security installations. Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small armies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and behavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or other purposes.

They can identify structural vulnerabilities and weak points and focus a blast in these areas. They can determine how to blast open a safe without destroying the contents. They can focus the force of an explosion in a particular direction, increasing the directed force while minimizing splash effects.</p>\n<p>Each of these scenarios calls for a successful Demolitions Test. The exact result is determined by the gamemaster according to the specific scenario. For example, using the examples above, targeting a weak point could double the damage inflicted on that structure. Shaping the charge to direct the force can triple the damage in that direction, as noted in the superthermite description. An Excellent Success is likely to increase an explosive''s damage by +5, whereas a critical success would allow the blast to ignore armor.</p>\n<h3>Disarming</h3>\n<p>Disarming an explosive device is handled as an Opposed Test between the Demolitions skills of the disarmer and the character who set the bomb.</p>\n<h3>Making Explosives</h3>\n<p>A character trained in Demolitions can make explosives from raw materials. These materials can be gathered the traditional way or they can be manufactured using a nanofabricator. Even nanofabbers with restricted settings to prevent explosives creation can be used, as explosives can be constructed from all manner of mundane chemicals and materials. The timeframe for making explosives is 1 hour per 1d10 points of damage the explosive will inflict. If a critical failure is rolled, the demolitionist may accidentally blow himself up, or the charge may be extremely weaker or more potent than expected (whichever is more likely to be disastrous).</p>', 'COG', '', 'AST', 'N'),
('Disguise', '<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>Disguise is the art of physically altering your appearance so that you look like someone else. This includes both the use of props (wigs, contacts, skin pigments) and the altering of subtle physical characteristics (gait, posture, poise).</p>\n<h2>When you use it</h2>\n<p>Use Disguise to fool someone into thinking you''re someone you''re not. This can be used to hide your identity or to make yourself look like someone in particular. When used against someone who knows your true look or the appearance of the person you are imitating, this is handled as an Opposed Test against Perception or Investigation.</p>\n<h2>Specializations</h2>\n<p>Cosmetic, Theatrical</p>', 'INT', '', 'AST', 'Y'),

A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. <br><br>Unless "unlocked" by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph''s DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the gamemaster''s discretion, Medicine Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging from âˆ’10 to âˆ’30.', 'NEG', 'MOR', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),

The character gains a +10 bonus on all Kinesics Tests made against transhumans. This bonus does not apply to other AGIs, uplifts, aliens, or exsurgents.', 'POS', 'EGO', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Alien Biochemistry', 'It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being trans- formed into pods by transhumance geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry''s similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. <br><br>\nWhile efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protec- tions offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regen- erate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. <br><br>\nMorphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). <br>\n<b>This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.</b>', 'POS', 'MOR', 0, 1, 'POD'),
('Allies', 'The character is part of or has a relationship with some influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character''s relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster''s should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character''s ties to this group are also a two-way street--they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios).', 'POS', 'EGO', 30, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Ambidextrous', 'The character can use and manipulate objects equally well with both hands <b> (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier, as noted under Wielding Two or More Weapons).</b> If the character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc.), this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. ', 'POS', 'EGO', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Animal Empathy', 'The character has an instinctive feel for handling and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. <b>Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or interact with an animal.</b>', 'POS', 'EGO', 5, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Anomalus Mind', 'Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the\nsubjects of highly experimental pyschosurgical procedures, your mental patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a âˆ’10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. <b>Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/ sleeving attempt will fail.</b>', 'NEG', 'EGO', 20, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Async Familiarity', 'This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence.', 'POS', 'EGO', 5, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Bad Luck', 'Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character''s Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character''s Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character''s friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait.', 'NEG', 'EGO', 30, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Beta', '<b>Warning ! You have to respect the limitations of this trait by yourself !</b><br><br>\nThis character is a beta fork of their original self,\nwhich for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than 60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited set of their original self''s memories--much of their previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the Edited Memories trait (p. 149, EP), without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are, of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained).', 'NEG', 'EGO', 20, 1, 'EVERY'),

('Blacklisted', 'The character has managed to get themselves blacklisted in certain circles, whether they actually did something to deserve it or not. In game terms, the character is barred from having a Rep score higher than 0 in one particular reputation network.

('Botched Merge', 'In the past, the character suffered a serious\ncomplication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason--perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance--the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of dissociation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a âˆ’10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.', 'NEG', 'EGO', 15, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Botched Uplift', '<b>This trait is only available to uplifts.</b><br><br> Although\npossessed of a rough self-awareness and the trappings of sapience, your mental development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limita- tions and serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you.', 'NEG', 'EGO', 30, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Brave', 'This character does not scare easily and will face threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm without flinching. As a side effect, the character is not always the best at gauging risks, especially when it comes to factoring in danger to others. <b>The character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or intimidation.</b>', 'POS', 'EGO', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Combat Paralysis', 'The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the character or they are surprised, the character must make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to the situation.', 'NEG', 'EGO', 20, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Common Sense', 'The character has an innate sense of judgment that\ncuts through other distractions and factors that might cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player may ask the gamemaster what choice they should make or what course of action they should take, and the gamemaster should give them solid advice based on what the character knows. Alternatively, if the character is about to make a disastrous decision, the gamemaster can use the character''s free hint and warn the player they are making a mistake.', 'POS', 'EGO', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),
('Coronal Adaptation', 'For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject''s metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electro- magnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the char- acter to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medicines.<br>\nFor synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph''s composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metama- terials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines.\nThis adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph''s Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong elec- tromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions).', 'POS', 'MOR', 30, 0, 'EVERY'),
('Curbed Intelligence', '<b>AGIs ONLY</b><br><br>\nFearful of AGIs that might develop into seed AIs like the TITANs, some developers have programmed extra safeguards and precautions into AGI mind- states to limit their intelligence.

If forced into close proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a âˆ’10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10 Ã· 2) SV per hour and take a âˆ’30 modifier to all actions. Luckily, phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours.<br><br>\nPhobia disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the gamemaster''s discretion, temporary phobias can be used as derangements inflicted with mental trauma (p. 209, EP). In these situations, the phobia should be linked to the particular source of trauma. For example, a character who suffers a trauma from remembering their death after vacuum exposure might pick up a derangement phobia of vacuum environments.', 'NEG', 'EGO', 10, 1, 'EVERY'),

('Planned Obsolescence', 'The morph is a hypercorp model that\nrequires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP "upgrades." If they fail to do so, the morph''s SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5.

('Unique Look', 'The morph is engineered to stand out in a society with sophisticated cloning and fabrication technology. The exact nature of the unique look varies based on the morph. Some employ proprietary technology secured by DRM in order to prevent others from copying the exact look of the morph. Others are secured by reputation alone--the look of an infamous triad crime boss would never be copied for fear of retribution.

It can wield two-handed weapons in one hand, but suffers a -20 modifier with medium-sized objects and cannot use small items or smaller, unless they come equipped with fine manipulators.
